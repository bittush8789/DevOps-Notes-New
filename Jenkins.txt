================================================
Build and deployment process
============================

1. Take latest source code from Git Hub
2. Compile Project source code.
3. Execute Unit Test case
4. Perform Code Review using sonarQube
5. Package the application (jar/war)
5. Upload Build Artifact  in Nexus 
6. Deploy the Application in Server
 

Environment: A platform which is used to run our application.

Application Environment:
=======================
Dev env : Developers will use perform code integration testing
QA env : Testers will use to perform functional testing
UAT env: User acceptance testing( client side team will perform application testing)
pilot env : It is also called pre-production enironment(Performane testing)
production env : Live enivronment: End users will access application running in PROD environment.


www.gmail.com --> Production env url of the project
www.facebook.com --> Production env url of the project

Development Team : Responsible for project development( Coding )
Testing Team: -> Responsible for functionality testing( Verifica tion & Validation )
Operation Team: -> Responsible for Build & Deployment Process

Dev +Ops => DevOps

Development + Operations ===> DevOps

DevOps is a process which is used to collobrate development team work & operations team work.


Challenges  in Mannual Process
==============================

Every day we need to deploy latest code.
Deploy code in multiple environment
Takes a lot of time
Repeated work
Error prone

Jenkins
==========

--> Jenkins is free software
--> Jenkins developed using java lanaguage
--> Jenkins is used to automate build & deployment process
--> We can implement CI CD using jenkins.

What is CI CD
===============

CI: Continuous integration
CD: Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment.

CI CD is one of the trending approach in software development life cycle.

==> CI CD is used to simplify and automate project deployment & delivery process

Continuous Integration: When code changes happen it should be ready to test.

Continuous Delivery : Keep it ready to release
Continuous Deployment :-> Deploy the project to production

Note:-> For Production deployment we need to take client approval.
